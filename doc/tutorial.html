<h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>Clojuratica is a Clojure library. It allows easy access to Mathematica from Clojure. The simplest paradigm for using Clojuratica is to write the program's control-flow in Clojure and make calls to Mathematica when necessary. This tutorial follows that paradigm.</p>

<p>The reverse paradigm is also possible. To evaluate Clojure code from Mathematica, simply create a Java class using the standard Clojure gen-class function and create instances of it according to the Mathematica J/Link documentation (or call its static methods). A Clojure class called in this way could use Clojuratica to convert data structures (aka expressions) passed from Mathematica, or to make follow-on calls to Mathematica.</p>

<h2><a name="basic_setup">Basic Setup</a></h2>

<p>Before doing anything else, make sure clojuratica.jar and the Mathematica J/Link jar are in the Java/Clojure classpath. The Mathematica J/Link jar is called JLink.jar and typically located in the AddOns/JLink subdirectory of the Mathematica installation. Some Mathematica versions will not install J/Link by default. If this is the case with yours, you can download J/Link free from the <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/solutions/mathlink/jlink/">Mathematica J/Link web site</a>.</p>

<p>Getting underway, let's <code>use</code> the Clojuratica package:</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>
=> (use 'clojuratica.clojuratica)
<tt>nil</tt>
</pre>
</code>
</p>

<p>Clojuratica needs to have access to a Mathematica kernel running locally or remotely. The simplest way to provide this access is to launch a local kernel from within Java. The procedure will vary slightly by platform and is dictated by the Mathematica J/Link package. On Windows, the following commands are appropriate. See the <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/JLink/tutorial/Overview.html">Mathematica J/Link user guide</a> for more details. Note that these commands have nothing to do with Clojuratica per se. They are general to any Java program that accesses Mathematica.</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>
=> (import '[com.wolfram.jlink MathLinkFactory])
<tt>nil</tt>

=> (def kernel-link (MathLinkFactory/createKernelLink 
                      (str "-linkmode launch -linkname "
                           "'c:/program files/wolfram research/"
                           "mathematica/7.0/mathkernel.exe'")))
<tt>#'user/kernel-link</tt>

=> (.discardAnswer kernel-link)
<tt>nil</tt>
</pre>
</code>
</p>

<p>Assuming the above code did not throw a MathLinkException, we now have an active kernel. Note that only one master kernel can be active at once under most Mathematica licenses. (More than one parallel kernel can be active; this is discussed later.)</p>

<h2><a name="the_evaluator">The Evaluator</a></h2>

<p>The basic Clojuratica function is the <strong>evaluator</strong>. Getting an evaluator is easy:</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>
=> (def evaluate (get-evaluator kernel-link))  <samp>;get an evalautor that knows where 
                                               ;the Mathematica kernel is</samp>
<tt>#'user/evaluate</tt>
</pre>
</code>
</p>

<p>Now we can do some math.</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>
=> (evaluate [] "1 + 1")  <samp>;evaluate the Mathematica expression 1+1</samp>
<tt>(#&lt;Expr Integer&gt;)</tt>
</pre>
</code>
</p>

<p>The evaluator's syntax is similar to that of Clojure's let. The first argument is a vector of assignments, empty here. The remaining arguments are Mathematica expressions to be evaluated.</p>

<p>The output of the evaluator is a Java object of class CExpr. CExpr stands for Clojuratica expression. It is a wrapper class for Mathematica expressions. It can hold <em>any</em> Mathematica expression, from a single integer to a sequence of operations on a hundred-dimensional array.</p>

<p>Remember that Mathematica expressions, and therefore CExprs, are homoiconic: they can house "pure data" (integers, vectors, matrices, etc.), symbols for symbolic math (x, y, etc.), and unevaluated mathematical expressions ("1+1", "x+y", "FactorInteger[15]", etc.).</p>

<p>This shows that the output of the evaluator is a CExpr:</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>
=> (class (evaluate [] "1 + 1"))
<tt>clojuratica.CExpr</tt>
</pre>
</code>
</p>

<h2><a name="the_parser">The Parser</a></h2>

<p>We can easily convert the CExprs we get as evaluator output into Clojure data structures. To do this we'll need a Clojuratica <strong>parser</strong>:</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>
=> (def parse (get-parser kernel-link))           <samp>;get a Clojuratica parser</samp>
<tt>#'user/parse</tt>

=> (parse (evaluate [] "1 + 1"))                  <samp>;parse the result of evaluating 1+1</samp>
<tt>2</tt>

=> (parse (evaluate [] "3x + 7 + 2x - (10/2)x"))  <samp>;symbolic math works too</samp>
<tt>7</tt>
</pre>
</code>
</p>

<p>Parse and evaluate are often used together. It's useful to compose them:</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>
=> (def math (comp parse evaluate))
<tt>#'user/math</tt>

=> (math [] "3x + 7 + 2x - (10/2)x")  <samp>;prettier syntax</samp>
<tt>7</tt>
</pre>
</code>
</p>

<p>The evaluator accepts multiple expressions:</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>
=> (math [] 
     "foo = 3x + 7 + 2x - (10/2)x"
     "foobar = foo + 3"
     "foobar ^ 2")
<tt>100</tt>
</pre>
</code>
</p>

<h2><a name="lists">Lists/Matrices/Arrays as Output</a></h2>

<p>The parser knows how to handle Mathematica lists and arrays. They are converted to Clojure data structures on the fly:</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>
=> (math [] "{{1, 0},
              {0, 1}} * 5")   <samp>;parse the result of multiplying the 2x2 identity matrix by 5</samp>
<tt>((5 0) (0 5))</tt>
</pre>
</code>
</p>

<p>The parser converts Mathematica lists to lazy seqs. Two-dimensional arrays (aka matrices) are converted to lazy seqs of lazy seqs. And so on for higher-dimensional arrays:</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>
=> (class
     (math [] "{{1, 0},
                {0, 1}} * 5"))
<tt>clojure.lang.LazySeq</tt>
</pre>
</code>
</p>

<p>Clojuratica has no problem parsing higher-dimensional Mathematica arrays. The following Mathematica code creates an eight-dimensional array, two elements in each direction, populated with ones:</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>
=> (math [] "ConstantArray[1, {2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2}]")
<tt>((((((((1 1) (1 1)) ((1 1) (1 1))) (((1 1) (1 1)) ((1 1) (1 1 <samp>... truncated ...</samp></tt>
</pre>
</code>
</p>

<h2><a name="lazy">Clojuratica is Lazy, and That's a Good Thing</a></h2>

<p>When parsing Mathematica lists and arrays, the seq returned by the parser is lazy. This is helpful for handling large data structures. Only the requested elements will be translated into Java/Clojure objects.</p>

<p>For instance, the following Mathematica expression creates a vector with 100,000 elements:</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>
=> (def long-vector (math [] "Table[i^2, {i, 100000}]"))
<tt>#'user/long-vector</tt>
</pre>
</code>
</p>

<p>Taking the first 10 elements is fast:</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>
=> (time (dorun (take 10 long-vector)))
<tt>"Elapsed time: 3.679797 msecs"</tt>
</pre>
</code>
</p>

<p>Whereas running through all the elements would take time:</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>
=> (time (dorun long-vector))
<tt>"Elapsed time: 4976.361032 msecs"</tt>
</pre>
</code>
</p>

<h2><a name="assignments">Assignments: Sending Data to Mathematica</a></h2>

<p>Recall that the evaluator permits assignments in its vector first argument. That means we can write:</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>
=> (math ["foo" 2] "foo + 10")  <samp>;evaluate and parse 2+10</samp>
<tt>12</tt>
</pre>
</code>
</p>

<p>The assigned objects can be Clojure data structures. They are automatically converted to Mathematica data structures where appropriate:</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>
=> (math ["foobar" [[1 0]
                    [0 1]]]
     "foobar * 2")
<tt>((2 0) (0 2))</tt>
</pre>
</code>
</p>

<p>Clojuratica handles large numbers without loss of precision, using as little memory as possible:</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>
=> (math ["bigint" 5847502438570428574320594860842574285743958445309854309574302750296843750]
     "bigint + 1")
<tt>5847502438570428574320594860842574285743958445309854309574302750296843751</tt>
</pre>
</code>
</p>

<p>Variables set in the evaluator's binding vector are lexically scoped within the evaluator call:</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>
=> (math [] "bigint")
<tt>#&lt;Expr bigint&gt;</tt>
</pre>
</code>
</p>

<p>Mathematica returned the symbol bigint rather than the number above, indicating that bigint was defined only in the scope of the evaluator call that bound it. Internally, Clojuratica wraps each call to the evaluator in a Mathematica Module[] and executes the module. Modules implement lexical scoping.</p>

<h2><a name="more_output">Requesting More than the Final Expression's Output</a></h2>

<p>By passing the :all-output flag to the evaluator, you can tell it to return the result of every expression in the call, not just the last. The flag can go anywhere among the arguments:</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>
=> (math [] :all-output
     "foo = 3x + 7 + 2x - (10/2)x"
     "foobar = foo + 3"
     "foobar ^ 2")
<tt>(7 10 100)</tt>
</pre>
</code>
</p>

<p>The flag can also be passed to get-evaluator, in which case it will be retained:</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>
=> (def evaluate* (get-evaluator kernel-link :all-output))
<tt>#'user/evaluate*</tt>

=> (def math* (comp parse evaluate*))
<tt>#'user/math*</tt>

=> (math* []
     "foo = 3x + 7 + 2x - (10/2)x"
     "foobar = foo + 3"
     "foobar ^ 2")
<tt>(7 10 100)</tt>
</pre>
</code>
</p>

<h2><a name="thread_safe">Clojuratica is Thread-Safe</a></h2>

<p>Rest assured that pieces of Mathematica code evaluated in different threads will not interact.</p>

<p>Let's define a function containing some Mathematica code that would act erratically if evaluated simultaneously in different threads (if Clojuratica were not thread-safe):</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>
=> (defn count-up [] (math ["counter" 0] 
                       "Do[counter++, {500000}]"
                       "counter"))
<tt>#'user/count-up</tt>
</pre>
</code>
</p>                     
                     
<p>Executing the function in four concurrent threads, we find that the counter variable acts reliably. If Clojuratica were not thread-safe, we would expect larger return values:</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>
=> (pvalues (count-up) (count-up) (count-up) (count-up))
<tt>(500000 500000 500000 500000)</tt>
</pre>
</code>
</p> 

<h2><a name="globals">Global Variables and the Global Setter</a></h2>

<p>Variables defined in the assignment vector of the evaluator are lexically scoped within that call to the evaluator. However, any variables defined in Mathematica expressions have global scope. This is a feature, not a bug, but be careful!</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>
=> (defn count-up2 [] (math [] "Do[counter++, {500000}]"      <samp>;counter assignment is gone</samp>
                               "counter"))
<tt>#'user/count-up2</tt>

=> (evaluate [] "counter = 0")                                <samp>;define counter---in a global scope!</samp>
<tt>(#&lt;Expr Integer&gt;)</tt>

=> (pvalues (count-up2) (count-up2) (count-up2) (count-up2))  <samp>;probably the "wrong" result...</samp>
<tt>(500000 1500000 1000000 2000000)</tt>
</pre>
</code>
</p> 

<p>Global Mathematica variables can be set explicitly using the <strong>global setter</strong> function:</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>
=> (def global-set (get-global-setter kernel-link))
<tt>#'user/global-set</tt>
</pre>
</code>
</p> 

<p>It is good practice to use this function whenever setting globals you care about, to avoid confusion like that of count-up2:</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>
=> (global-set "year" 2009)
<tt>(#&lt;Expr Integer&gt;)</tt>

=> (math [] "year")
<tt>2009</tt>
</pre>
</code>
</p> 

<p> Another reason to use the global setter is that it will accept arbitrary Clojure data structures. The global setter is the only way to store an arbitrary Clojure data structure as a global Mathematica variable. (Reminder: To store a Clojure data structure as a lexically scoped variable, use the assignment vector of the evaluator.)</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>
=> (global-set "recentyears" [2009 2008 2007 2006])
<tt>(#&lt;Expr List&gt; 2009 2008 2007 2006)</tt>

=> (math [] "recentyears - 2000")
<tt>(9 8 7 6)</tt>
</pre>
</code>
</p> 

<p>A third good reason to use the global setter is that it automatically distributes assignments to all parallel kernels. Which brings us to...</p>

<h2><a name="parallelism">Clojuratica Supports Parallelism</a></h2>

<p>We saw above that the Clojuratica evaluator is thread-safe. In fact, thread-safety is just the beginning.</p>

<p> Clojuratica can also parallelize. It can distribute Mathemtaica computations from multiple Clojure threads to multiple Mathematica kernels, which may be running on multiple cores or multiple machines across a cluster or grid. Clojuratica does this by adding a thread-ready concurrency layer to Mathematica's built-in parallelism features.</p>

<p>Using Clojuratica's parallel evaluator, you can have, say, 10,000 Clojure threads all sending different expressions to Mathematica. Clojuratica will adaptively farm each expression out to the next available Mathematica kernel and ensure that the right Mathematica output is returned to the right Clojure thread.</p>

<p> The parallel evaluator has two big selling points. First, kernels are never idle while there are expressions left to evaluate. Second, the parallel evaluator's concurrency queue is robust to having fewer kernels than threads. Threads share kernels adaptively. This latter feature is important because Mathematica's kernels are "heavy" memory-wise and are limited in number by the availability of Mathematica licenses.</p>

<p>On a hypothetical 50-core machine we would ideally have 50 Mathematica kernels available. The Clojuratica concurrency queue will ensure that every expression evaluated by one of our 10,000 Clojure threads is farmed out to one of the 50 kernels. While a thread waits for its computation to finish, that thread is blocked. The queue, however, is never blocked. Other threads can send expressions to Mathematica at any time. A CPU-heavy computation from one thread will not block a CPU-light computation from a different thread from finishing on a different kernel.</p>

<p> Mathematica has support for an arbitrarily large number of kernels running on local cores or linked over a network. The number of kernels is limited only by the number of licenses available. This means that, in theory, you could have tens of thousands of Clojure threads evaluating thousands of expressions per minute, all being farmed out to hundreds of Mathematica kernels across a cluster or grid.</p>

<p>Because Clojuratica's concurrency queue is built on top of Mathematica's built-in parallelism capabilities, the set-up of the parallel Mathematica kernels is done in Mathematica itself:</p>

 <image of setup>

<p>The same configuration dialog allows the configuration of remote kernels across a cluster or the internet.</p>

<p>The Clojuratica evaluator we created earlier in the tutorial will not parallelize by default. To get a parallel evaluator, use the :parallel keyword anywhere in the call to get-evaluator:</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>
=> (def pevaluate (get-evaluator kernel-link :parallel))   <samp>;get a parallel evaluator</samp>
<tt>#'user/pevaluate</tt>

=> (def pmath (comp parse pevaluate))   <samp>;compose a new convenience function</samp>
<tt>#'user/pmath</tt>

</pre>
</code>
</p> 

<p>The parallel evaluator has exactly the same syntax as the serial (regular) evaluator:</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>
=> (pevaluate [] "1 + 1")
<tt>(#&lt;Expr Integer&gt;)</tt>

=> (pmath [] "1 + 1")
<tt>2</tt>
</pre>
</code>
</p> 

<p>Now we'll test whether parallel evaluation works faster that serial evaluation on my dual-core machine.</p>

<p>First, let's create a vector of thirty agents. These thirty agents are going to end up storing the results of the thirty CPU-intensive computations we are going to farm out to thirty Clojure threads and, in turn, multiple Mathematica kernels.</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>
=> (def output-vector
     (vec (for [i (range 30)] (agent nil))))  <samp>;create a vector of thirty agents</samp>
<tt>#'user/output-vector</tt>
</pre>
</code>
</p> 

<p>The expression we are going to evaluate thirty times over is a simple integer factorization. A single instance of this computation takes about two seconds on my dual-core laptop.</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>
=> (def expression "FactorInteger[42039483204432094832932317913181713501317130511]")
<tt>#'user/expression</tt>

=> (time (math [] expression))
<tt>"Elapsed time: 2650.140242 msecs"
((7 1) (47 1) (2091308860889 1) (2947175658767 1) (20731812453782440993 1))</tt>
</pre>
</code>
</p> 

<p>To evaluate the expression thirty times over in parallel, we can simply send-off each agent with an instruction to update itself with the result of a call to the parallel evaluator. Clojure farms out the "send-off" instructions to separate threads. This means that the parallel evaluator is receiving expressions from thirty different threads at once.</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>
=> (doseq [output-agent output-vector]  <samp>;for each agent in the output vector...</samp>
     (send-off output-agent (fn [_] (pmath [] expression))))
                                 <samp>;update the agent with the result of the expression</samp>
<tt>nil</tt>
</pre>
</code>
</p> 

<p>We can time how long it takes for all thirty expressions to complete by monitoring the output vector. When it has no more nils in it, all thirty expressions have completed. I ran the following command immediately after the doseq command above.</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>
=> (time
     (while (some #(nil? @%) output-vector)
       (Thread/sleep 50)))
<tt>"Elapsed time: 68123.793457 msecs"</tt>
</pre>
</code>
</p> 

<p>Since 68,123 ms is shorter than 30 times 2,650 ms (=79,500 ms), it's clear that parallelization is effective. The improvement isn't by a factor of two as it should be in theory, but my laptop isn't exactly an Azul box.</p>

<p> Keep in mind that the concurrency queue can handle evaluations from an arbitrarily large  number of threads. The overhead for each evaluation is quite low. Let's evaluate 10,000 CPU-light expressions.</p>

<p>Create a vector of agents to store the results of 10,000 computations:</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>
=> (def output-vector
     (vec (for [i (range 10000)] (agent nil))))
<tt>#'user/output-vector</tt>
</pre>
</code>
</p> 

<p>We are going to execute Sqrt[i] 10,000 times, where i is the index of the current agent in the output vector. We use "send" instead of "send-off" because my machine doesn't have memory for 10,000 threads. A powerful multicore machine or Terracotta cluster might. ("Send" updates its agent using a thread from a limited thread pool. The threads are recycled, and at a certain point "send" will wait for a thread from the thread pool to become available rather than create a new thread. "Send-off" always creates a new thread when there are no idle threads in the thread pool. "Send-off" can therefore create an arbitrarily large number of threads, possibly eating up all the JVM's memory.)</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>
=> (doseq [i (range (count output-vector))]  <samp>;for each agent in the output vector</samp>
     (send (nth output-vector i)
           (fn [_] (pmath ["i" i] "Sqrt[i] // N"))))
                           <samp>;compute the sqrt of the index of that agent.
                           ;note that //N is Mathematica shorthand for
                           ;"evaluate numerically rather than symbolically"</samp>
<tt>nil</tt>
</pre>
</code>
</p> 

<p>Wait for the results:</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>
=> (time
     (while (some #(nil? @%) output-vector)
       (Thread/sleep 50)))
<tt>"Elapsed time: 63143.038501 msecs"</tt>
</pre>
</code>
</p> 

 This implies that the total overhead per computation is around 6.3 ms, since we computed 10,000 expressions and the entire task took 63,000 ms.
 Check that the right thing has happened:

<p>
<code>
<pre>
=> @(nth output-vector 2500)
<tt>50.0</tt>
</pre>
</code>
</p>

<p>Note that each call to the Clojuratica evaluator is sent to a *single* kernel. Only when multiple threads are making Mathematica calls simultaneously will the calls be distributed to multiple kernels. If you need to parallelize a single Mathematica expression, such as a call to Map[], you should use Mathematica's built-in parallelization functions, such as Parallelize[].</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>
=> (math [] "Parallelize[Map[FactorInteger, {1, 11, 111, 1111, 11111}]]")
<tt>(((1 1)) ((11 1)) ((3 1) (37 1)) ((11 1) (101 1)) ((41 1) (271 1)))</tt>
</pre>
</code>
</p>

<p>Another final note: The global setter automatically distributes global variables to all parallel kernels.</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>
=> (global-set "identity" [[1 0] [0 1]])
<tt>(#<Expr List> (1 0) (0 1))</tt>

=> (pvalues (pmath [] "identity * 2") (pmath [] "identity / 2 // N"))
<tt>(((2 0) (0 2)) ((0.5 0.0) (0.0 0.5)))</tt>
</pre>
</code>
</p>

<p>That covers the features of Clojuratica. Enjoy!</p>
